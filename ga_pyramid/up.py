# This file is to create test records.  If the testing framework gets more
# fleshed out, this will be called in the setUp portion of the test suite.
# Otherwise, it is simply a place for you to put test data records to be taken
# on advisement. Likewise, the testdata/ directory should be used to host
# test data files that will be loaded by this script, so as not to pollute
# the main application directory.  There's nothing automatic about this, but
# it's instead suggested as a way to maintain consistency across developers.
